# ChatGPT-fixMargins Chrome Extension


## Overview

This Chrome extension aims to address the issue of excessive, space-wasting margins in ChatGPT's WebUI (chat.openai.com). When working with code outputs or lengthy responses, the default margins can make it difficult to see the full content. This extension modifies the CSS to offer a more streamlined and efficient use of screen real estate.
